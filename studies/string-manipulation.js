/**
 * STRING MANIPULATION
 * 
 * Strings are values, just like any data type in Javascript, and as such we can manipulate them using
 * operators as well as methods native to the string data type. Since they are zero indexed, we can 
 * manipulate the sting in it's entirety, or access a single value within the string.
