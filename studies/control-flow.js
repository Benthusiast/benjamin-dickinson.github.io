/**
 * CONTROL FLOW
 * 
 * Control flow is the use of conditional statements to determine what code happens when in a program.
 * It is possible to have some code execute under certain condtions, and other code execute under
 * others.

// if Statements use a conditional and execute a code block if the conditional resolved true

// else if Statements follow if statements and execute a block of code when the if conditional resolved 
// false, and the else if conditional resolved as true 

// else Statements follow if statements or end if-else if chains and execute the code block within when all
// the previous conditionals resolved as false. Often used to create the default option of conditional code.

// switch Statements establish a variable, and executes the block of code based on the "case", or value, of 
// the switch variable
