/**
 * OPERATORS
 * 
 * Operators perform actions, or operations, on values in Javascript.
 * Using operators to build expressions, we can create and change values

 *   
 * There are many types of Operators, organized by their general use.

 * Assignment Operators like = and += assign or reassign variables to given or resulting values.

myInt += 1; //the value of myInt is reassigned to the result of 74 + 1 => 75

// -=
myInt -=1 //the value of myInt is reassigned to the result of 75 - 1 => 74

myInt *=2 //the value of myInt is reassigned to the result of 74 * 2 => 148

// /=
