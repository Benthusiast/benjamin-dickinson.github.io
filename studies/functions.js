//Declarations

//parameters vs arguments
//syntax for a named function
//how do we assign a function to a variable
// functions can optionally take inputs and optionally return a single value how do we specify inputs and outputs
//scope, functions can see variables in parent scopes but not child scopes
//closures, functions form closures around the data they house. if an object returned by a fucntion is held in memory somewhere (referenced), 
//that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures.
